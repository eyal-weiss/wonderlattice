# Project state — 2026-09-24

## Maintainability refactor — 2026-09-24 (branch `agent/maintainability`)

The single 92 KB `index.html`, written as minified one-line code, is now readable files: `styles/` (4 stylesheets),
`src/core/` (namespace, shared stage, app shell), `src/features/` (visitors, trail), and `src/rooms/<id>/` (a pure
`model.js` and a `room.js` per room). Rooms register themselves in one registry. Navigation, keyboard order, shared
links, trail validation, and agent tools all derive from it, replacing about eight hand-maintained room lists. The page
still opens from disk with no build.

Visitor behaviour is unchanged. 17 browser tests were written against the original code first and pass unchanged on
the new code. Deterministic screenshots of 27 states (every room, dialogs, trail, reduced motion, 320–1280 px) match
the original pixel for pixel, apart from sub-frame animation timing noise. Deliberate small changes:

- "Trace it all" strokes neighbouring same-colour segments together: 1.3–1.7× faster (about 670 → 380 ms on a 4×
  throttled phone CPU), visually identical.
- The "My trail" header icon is ✧ instead of ↗ (it opened a dialog, not a link, and duplicated the traffic icon).
- The page description mentions the traffic room.
- A shared drawing link without `room=` now also switches to the drawing room when it arrives by hash change.

Tooling: Vite is replaced by zero-dependency `scripts/serve.mjs` and `scripts/build.mjs`. The build writes `dist/` and
`dist/wonderloom-standalone.html` (one ~480 KB file with portraits inlined). Added 12 model unit tests, 18 Playwright
browser tests, ESLint, Prettier, and GitHub Actions CI that runs everything on each pull request.

## Working and included

- Geometry: drawing with combined rotations, presets, parameter controls, PNG export.
- Waves: summed signals, audible tones, phase cancellation, beats, Lissajous portraits.
- Emergence: adjustable flocking model, pointer interaction, neighbor view.
- Topology: interactive projected ribbon, half-twists, highlighted edges, traveler.
- Networks: Braess traffic paradox with adjustable demand, visible route markers, and a before/after travel-time
  comparison (65 → 80 minutes at 4,000 drivers).
- Mathematician visitors: two per room, historical portraits in paper-puppet bodies, original captions, biography and
  portrait-source links. Figures without a trustworthy likeness were left out (Hypatia, Sophie Germain, Dietrich Braess).
- My trail: saved stills, settings and notes, later reflections, links between related rooms, JSON export/import,
  browser-local only, 24 moments.
- Optional explanations, browser narration, link/settings sharing, responsive layout, reduced motion.
- Offline use, a single-file export, MIT license, AI handoff, architecture, and translation guides.

## Not yet done

- An in-app "Make your own version" flow: source download and an AI prompt containing the current settings.
- Hebrew (or other) translation. Visitor-facing words now live in room definitions, which makes this easier, but
  there's no language dictionary or selector yet.
- Publishing for public visitors under an owner-controlled account. The last ChatGPT-hosted site was owner-only.
  GitHub Pages on this private repository needs a paid plan; Cloudflare Pages or Netlify work on free plans.
- Manual release checks that automation can't do: listening to audio and narration, real phones, screen readers.
- A short demo video and social launch material. Nothing has been posted.
- A permanent link from the personal website, once feedback warrants it.

## Next priorities

1. Review and merge `agent/maintainability`.
2. Decide on hosting and publish `dist/`.
3. New rooms or features, one branch and pull request each (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md has the add-a-room checklist).
